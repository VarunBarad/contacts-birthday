<h2>Log Files</h2>

<p>
    Contacts Calendar follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit

    files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp,
    referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any information that is personally
    identifiable. The purpose of the information is for analyzing trends and administering the site.
